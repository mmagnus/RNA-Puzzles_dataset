# RNA-Puzzles dataset
This repository includes all the submitted RNA structures in RNA-Puzzles. 

Raw dataset contains structures submitted to the organizers without any correction.

Normalize dataset contains  structures processed using PDBnormalizer, which only use the aligned segments and drop the missing atoms. This is used for prediction evaluation.

We also provide https://github.com/RNA-Puzzles/RNA-Puzzles-Normalized-submissions which is normalized with rna-tools, which unmodify the nucleotides, add missing atoms. This is used for training scoring functions.
